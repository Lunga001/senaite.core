For some big processes which do not affect users' use of Bika, it is possible to add
ASYNCHRONOUS tasks which will run in background. In order to enable that, you must add tho following
lines in buildout.cfg:

1. Eggs part:

egg=
...
collective.taskqueue
...



2. and the following lines under [instance] section

zope-conf-additional =
    %import collective.taskqueue
    <taskqueue>
    queue sanitation-tasks
    </taskqueue>
    <taskqueue-server>
    queue sanitation-tasks
    </taskqueue-server>
